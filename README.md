# PRodigy_ML_01
Implementing a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based.
## Overview
The code evaluate linear regression model for predicting house prices based on their square footage and number of bedrooms and bathrooms, using a dataset containing information about residential properties.
#### Datasets
The dataset: 1. train.csv - the training set 2. test.csv - the test set 3. data_description.txt -  has full description of each column, 4. sample_submission.csv

#### Technologies Used:
1.Python: programming language used.

2.pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.

3.Matplotlib:for data visualization.

4.Seaborn:for plotting

5.scikit-learn: Provides machine learning tools for building regression models, feature scaling, and polynomial feature generation.

####R squared score: 0.4507077777046916 
R-squared is a statistical measure that helps us understand how well the independent variables in a regression model explain the variation of the dependent variable.
It's a number between 0 and 1, or 0% and 100%.
